          Realtime Air Quality Monitoring using AI and IoT is a project aimed at addressing the challenges the traditional air quality monitoring systems. These conventional systems are often expensive, bulky, and lack the flexibility needed for real-time data collection. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), this project provides an affordable, portable, and efficient solution for monitoring air quality. The system utilizes combination of many sensors as an entity, that can be deployed in various locations, enabling continuous data collection and analysis. This not only reduces costs but also ensures that critical air quality information is readily available, this will empowering users to make informed decisions to combat environmental issues.

            The project is being developed by Olaleke Oluwasyi Hezekiah, a final year student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, under the guidance and supervision of Prof. A.S Osunleke. The goal is to create a user-friendly platform where air quality data is accessible in real-time, promoting awareness and proactive measures to mitigate pollution. By integrating AI algorithms, the system can predict trends and identify potential pollution hotspots, providing actionable insights for academia, environmentalists, and the general public. The mobility of the IoT-based sensors allows for deployment in remote or underserved areas, ensuring comprehensive coverage and fostering equitable access to environmental data.

            In addition to its main functionality, this project emphasizes sustainability and scalability. It highlights the importance of community involvement in environmental monitoring and encourages collaboration between governments, organizations, and individuals. Future enhancements could include mobile applications for real-time alerts, integration with smart city infrastructure, and partnerships with environmental agencies to amplify its impact. Suggestions for the webpage could include sections like "Our Mission," which outlines the long-term goals of the project, "Team," to introduce key contributors, and "Get Involved," to encourage participation from volunteers or sponsors. Adding testimonials or case studies showcasing the system's effectiveness in pilot programs could also build credibility and attract interest.
